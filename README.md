#DumphpDB

**DumphpDB is a easy way to save your working database.**

If you have are working on a new project, it means that, like always, your database is going to have a lot of versions, with the progress we make, we always find something we want to change. 

So if you work in more than one place, or in a team, you probably use a git to save your work, and then pull the changes. 
This plugin allows you to save your current database, and then upload it along with your current project's directory's, and then after pulling your commit, you just update the database, with just two clicks in a single page, and this is it!

##Usage

Download/Clone this repository inside somewhere in your project's folder

Open the file conf.json, set your credentials and the name of your Database

In your browser, go to the index of DumphpDB, and enjoy.
